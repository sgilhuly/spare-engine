# spare-engine
Open-source C++ game engine using OpenGL, SDL, Lua, Bullet physics

I'm making a game engine mostly for fun and learning.

## High Level To-do List
- [ ] Finish OpenGL tutorial ([here](http://www.opengl-tutorial.org/))
- Mostly done, I'll add lighting later
- [ ] Implement Entity-Component-System design ([reference](http://gamedevs.org/uploads/data-driven-game-object-system.pdf))
- Going to try different pre-made ECS implementations ([corgi?](http://google.github.io/corgi/index.html))
- [ ] Add Lua scripts to game objects
- [ ] Add Bullet physics to game objects
- [ ] Load resources from zip archives
- Low  priority
